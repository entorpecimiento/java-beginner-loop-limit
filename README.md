# 🚀 Retail Payroll System

This project features a Java implementation designed to automate salary calculations for retail staff by processing bonuses and statutory deductions.

## ⚙️ Functionality
The application allows the user to calculate payroll for three specific categories:
1. **Stock Clerk (Repositor):** Base salary calculation ($15,890) plus a 10% performance bonus.
2. **Cashier (Cajero):** Fixed monthly salary processing ($25,630.89).
3. **Supervisor:** Gross salary calculation ($35,560.20) with an automatic 11% pension deduction.

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights
* **Logic:** Implementation of nested `if-else` structures for category selection and input validation.
* **Input Handling:** Dynamic data entry processing using the `Scanner` class via console.
* **Precision:** Use of floating-point data types for accurate currency and percentage handling.

## 📋 Requirements
* **JDK 8** or higher.
* **Java Execution Tool** (any IDE like NetBeans or a standard terminal).
